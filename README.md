## Code_Challenge_Alternate_Capitals

In this Repo I will attempt to code one of the CodeWars Katas - Alternate Capitals. This one took me a little bit of time. I ended up having to use two if statements, one to go through each letter and one to make it capital or not. It looks like most of the simple solutions were done using enumerate. At least I was able to figure out the i % 2 part for the evens!

## Task

Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.


## Examples:

capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']
